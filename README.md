# gitsh

The `gitsh` program is an interactive shell for git. From within `gitsh` you can
issue any git command, even using your local aliases and configuration.

## Installing from the repository

If you want to install from the repository (perhaps to try out some
modifications) or build a new distribution, you will need to:

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the configuration files

        ./autogen.sh

3. Configure and build the project.

        ./configure
        make

    Configuration may fail if it can't find Ruby 2.0 or later. If you have
    multiple Ruby versions installed you can explicitly provide a path to the
    correct version in the `$RUBY` variable.

        ./configure RUBY=/example/bin/ruby
        make

4. If you want to install from the repository, you can do so using make.

        make install

    Alternatively, at this point you can build a new distribution.

        make distcheck
